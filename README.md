This project of CNN image classification contains in three files (just for my learning purpose)
<br>
Part 1 - Basic CNN Image classification of CIFAR-10 dataset upto 10 epochs and comparision with ANN model accuracy.
<br>
Part 2 - Applying basic hyperparameter tuning to optimize the CNN model (dropout_rate, learning_rate using RandomSearch tuner upto 10 trials)
<br>
Part 3 - moving to advanced hyperparameter tuning such as tuning the Convolutional layer, Dense Layers, dropout rate, learning rate.
